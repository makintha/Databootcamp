# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

## Background

In this homework we are calculating the poll result. For this I have created dictionary called: **Election_Result** with the following keys:
 * **Name**, to save the name of candidates 
 * **Vote**, to store the number of the vote for each candidate (inside **Vote**, I have created another keys which is equal to candidate name, Vote = {'Name1':[], 'Name2':[], 'Name-n': []))
 * **Pct**, to store the percentage of the vote for each candidate received (inside **Vote**, I have created another keys which is equal to candidate name, Pct = {'Name1':[], 'Name2':[], 'Name-n': []))

Result are print out both to terminal and text file. I have created folder Analysis and save the result in the folder as out_pypoll.txt.

The results are shown below:
```
